            <p class="banner-text">Considering how hard it's been for us since last few weeks in commuting to/from work,school and other places of interest and emergencies. "setakhalicha.com" was born out of sheer desire to come out with a central portal that could help wonderful, kind-hearted, generous individuals, who have taken it a step further and helped other needy people hitch a ride in their cards/bikes. Even though the world may come to a halt, but we cannot let this current state of affairs keep us from doing what we do best.</p>

            <p class="banner-text">With "seatkhalicha" you can either put yourself/your vehicle up for a carpool at a scheduled date/time. OR, you can request to be carpooled if you happen to fall in the commute route of the carpooler</p>
            <p class="banner-text">If you are looking to share a ride with the folks who are in the lookout for one, click "Share". Else, if like many of us, you are looking for someone who would help pick you up, click "Request" .</p>
            <p class="banner-text">They might not ask for it, but please show some love and respect towards those who've helped you!</p>
            <p class="banner-text">This platform is provided in an as is basis and we, the developers are in no way to be blamed from any consequences arising, what-so-ever by the using of this portal or by sharing the rides.
